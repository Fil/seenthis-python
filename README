to the short-blogging service SeenThis <http://seenthis.net/> from
Python.

*** Install ***

1) Short method

# python setup.py install

2) Long method, if the above does not work or if you want to know more

This module uses "distribute", which should be compatible with
"setuptools". If it is not present, it is automatically
downloaded. Same thing for the required modules, which are searched on
PyPi and installed. If you prefer to use local versions, be sure to
install them before running setup.py.

OS-specific notes:

Debian: install packages "python-setuptools python-simpletal
python-feedparser" before running setup.py and you'll benefit from
Debian packaging for most of the modules.

Gentoo: TODO

*** Usage ***

Examples of use are the scripts seenthis-backup.py (to backup all your
seens) and seenthis-post.py (to post a message).

Both need a file storing SeenThis authentication info. The file must
be named $HOME/.seenthis/auth and contain two lines, one for the user
name and one for the password.

*** API ***

The SeenThis API is documented (in French only) in 
<http://seenthis.net/fran%C3%A7ais/mentions/article/api>
