To install;

$ python setup.py install

Examples of use are the scripts seenthis-backup.py (to backup all your
seens) and seenthis-post.py (to post a message).

Both need a file storing SeenThis authentication info. The file must
be named $HOME/.seenthis/auth and contain two lines, one for the user
name and one for the password.
